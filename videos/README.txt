Put the pitch video file here named `pitch.mp4`.
The player in `pitch/index.html` will load it automatically when present.

For GitHub commits keep `pitch.mp4` below 100 MB. If you keep a heavier master copy locally, name it `pitchpesado.mp4` (ignored by git) and re-encode to an optimized `pitch.mp4` before pushing.
